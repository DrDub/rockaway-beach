<h1>Surfing</h1>

<h2>Beaches</h2>
<p>Dedicated surfing spots are located at:
  <ul>
    <li>Beach 67th to 69st Street (most spacious area)</li>
    <li>Beach 87st to 92nd Street</li>
    <li>Beach 110th to 111th Street</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The A train will take you directly to Beach 67th Street (make sure you're on the Far Rockaway A train). For the other beaches, take the A train to Broad Channel, and switch to the shuttle train.</p>
<p>Technically, you could also take the 2 train to Brooklyn College, then the Q35 bus to Riis Beach, and the Q22 bus down to any of these beaches. It may take you longer depending on where you're coming from. </p>

<h2>Renting equipment</h2>
<h3>Locals Surf School</h3>
<p>Text or email them a day in advance, and they'll put a foam board on the side for you. You can pick it up from their tent at Beach 67th. They're usually on the beach by 8AM -- great if you want to ride early.</p>

<h3>Breakwater Surf</h3>
<p>Located off the train at beach 67th, they open at 8AM on the weekends and 9AM during the week. They have various boards: foam boards and hard top boards (from 6' to 9'). On the weekend during the summer, get there before 10:30AM to be able to find a board to rent. They sell out quickly. <a href="http://breakwatersurfcompany.com/" target="_blank">Visit website</a>.</p>

<h3>Boarders Surf Shop</h3>

They open at 10AM in all locations and offer a wide range of boards options: foam boards and hard top boards (from 6' to 9').
